## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this project, I have learned the use of clamp property to make images, fonts, widths, and heights responsive. The use of the clamp property has reduced my code. The code I use to write to make things responsive is now reduced to one line using the clamp property. I have also learned how to use the "srcset" attribute of the image tag in HTML, though I have not used it in this project.


### Continued development

The clamp property was very useful, and I will refine and perfect it.

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me for making things responsive. I really liked this property and will use it going forward.
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use the "srcset". I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
